            <h1>PHP South Africa 2018 Attendee Profiles</h1>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Once again this year, a core theme at the <a href="http://phpsouthafrica.com" target="_blank">PHP SA 2018 Conference</a>
                has been the importance of getting involved in OpenSource projects. This is why we have dusted off our yearly
                humorous educational project.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have been thinking about getting involved in OpenSource but the whole exercise seems daunting, we invite
                you to sign up a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Account</a> and submit a
                <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">Pull Request</a> to the
                the <a href="https://github.com/mostertb/phpsa-2018-profiles">phpsa-2018-profiles</a> project (the code that generates this
                page) as a way to get you started.
            </p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                The main idea is to provide a safe environment in which to practice the mechanics of contributing to a GitHub
                project in order to break down one more barrier between you and one of the world's most addictive hobbies.<br>
                If you're already an open source contributor/maintainer, this is also a great platform to recommend projects
                for other attendee to get involved in.
            </p>
            <p>
                By submitting a profile, you also get an opportunity introduce yourself and jump into the all-important "Hallway Track"
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, though, its fun to hack away at some code over the week
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you've gotten your feet wet by submitting your first pull request, we recommend that you go have a
                look at Digital Ocean's <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Hacktoberfest</a>
                initiative
            </p>

            <p>You may also want to look at <strong>TODO.md</strong> in this project if you'd like to continue to contribute here...</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>So this is the fourth time we are doing this... Its a PHP SA tradition now</p>

            <h4>2015</h4>
            <p>
                At the PHP Craft Conference 2015 the contributors of this project played a little joke.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2015 conference organisers had decided to hold a competition to win a
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">JetBrains PHPStorm</a> license. To enter,
                attendees simply had to submit a Pull Request... to any OpenSource project. So we created a project!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Everyone was disqualified... :)</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>2016</h4>
            <p>
                At the 2016 conference we tried to go legitimate to see if we could get away with it. We did. Zander was grumpy
                with us. It was hilarious
            </p>

            <h4>2017</h4>
            <p>
                In 2017 the Cape Town conference attendees absolutly knocked the project out the park:
                <a href="http://www.phpsa2017profiles.co.za/public/" target="_blank">PHP SA 2017 Profiles</a>.
                This year the aim is to outdo last year
            </p>
